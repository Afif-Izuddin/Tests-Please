Game Dev Project Group 14

I added Navid's code for gradic logic and split it into 3 and also added a bunch of stuff

Things not done:
UI/UX  
Game Overs  
Money (Something)  
SFX ( Add it in AudioManager.cs, if there's more than just add more  
    // public AudioClip buttonClickSFX;
    // public AudioClip correctAnswer;
    // public AudioClip wrongAnswer;
    // public AudioClip timeTicking;
    // public AudioClip dayEnd;
    // public AudioClip gameOver;
)
Story Picture (Can Skip)  
Ending Screen (Good or bad ending or just one ending)  

I'll add explanation later
